# Object Tracking

This is where all the code for finding the ball from camera video.
Also check our team's folder in the NURC Google Drive for more information.

To build, run the following commands after every change to main.cpp:

cd build
cmake ..
make
./cv_nurc_lax


Any issues - try deleting everything in the /build folder first to clear all the cache for CMake

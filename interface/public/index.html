<h2>About the LAX Bot</h2>
    <p>
        The Lacrosse Goalie Team is focused on developing a mechanical goalie that uses computer
    stereo vision to track and anticipate a lacrosse ball. The team has both mechanical and
    software engineering groups that work together towards building a stationary robot capable
    of finding and reacting to objects travelling at over 75mph! This project is great for those
    who want to learn more about computer vision and desire to explore the intersect between designing
    software and hardware that work well together.
